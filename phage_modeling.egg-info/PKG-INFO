# Phage Modeling

Phage Modeling is a Python package designed to facilitate the machine-learning (ML)-based prediction of phage-host interactions based on gene content of phage and host genomes from amino acid (AA) sequences of protein coding genes and an interaction matrix of experimentally validate phage-host interactions. `phage_modeling` include the following functionalities in its workflows:

1. __Clustering with MMSeqs2__: Cluster AA sequences of phages and hosts into gene families.
2. __Gene Family Presence-Absence Matrices__: Generate presence-absence matrices of gene families in phage and host genomes
3. __Feature Table Construction__: Build feature tables based on co-occurrence patterns of gene families. Gene families with identical occurrence patterns across all genomes are collapsed into a single feature.
4. __Feature Selection__: ML-assisted identification of protein family features that are predictive of phage-host interactions in a given dataset using recursive feature elimination (RFE).
5. __CatBoost ML Pipelines__: Execute CatBoost-based pipelines for interaction prediction, including hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluation, and performance vizualization.
6. __Prediction of New Interactions__: Assign gene family features to new genomes and predict their interactions with existing datasets.

## Installation

### Virtual Environment (_optional_)

We recommend installing this package in a virtual environment. To generate a `conda` environment for this package, run the following:

```bash
conda create -n phage_modeling python=3

```

## External Dependencies
This package requires `MMseqs2` for clustering and sequence assignment. You can install it via conda or mamba: 
__With conda__:

```bash

## Usage

### Full Workflow

#### Workflow Overview:

1. **Clustering of Genomes**: 
   The first step involves clustering the gene sequences of both host (strain) and phage genomes using MMseqs2. The clustering results in gene families, and each genome's genes are assigned to clusters. This step generates the cluster assignments for both the host and phage genomes.

2. **Feature Table Generation**: 
   Feature tables are created for the strain and phage genomes based on the gene families they are assigned to. These tables represent the presence or absence of specific gene families across all genomes.

3. **Merging Feature Tables**: 
   The strain and phage feature tables are merged using the provided interaction matrix, which contains validated interactions between strains and phages.

4. **Feature Selection**: 
   Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and other feature selection methods are applied to the merged feature table to identify the most predictive gene families (features) for host-phage interactions. Multiple iterations of feature selection are performed, and the results are saved.

5. **Modeling**: 
   Using the selected features, machine learning models (CatBoost) are trained to predict host-phage interactions. The model is evaluated using performance metrics like ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves, and the trained models are saved for future predictions.

6. **Interaction Prediction**: 
   Once the model is trained, it is used to predict interactions between new genomes and phages. The predictions are outputted with confidence scores for each potential interaction.

To run the entire workflow from feature table generation to modeling, you can use the `run-full-workflow` CLI command or call it directly in Python

### Assign and Predict Workflow

The `assign_predict` workflow involves assigning new sequences to pre-existing clusters, generating feature tables for new genomes, and making predictions of phage-host interactions using pre-trained models.

#### Workflow Overview:

1. __Assign Sequences to Clusters__: New genome sequences are assigned to existing MMseqs2 clusters based on similarity to previously clustered sequences. This step generates the cluster assignments for the new genomes.

2. __Feature Table Generation__: A feature table is created for each new genome based on the clusters they were assigned to. This table is used as input for interaction prediction models.

3. __Interaction Prediction__: Pre-trained models are used to predict interactions between new genomes (e.g., strains) and phages. The predictions are saved with confidence scores for each interaction.

__CLI__:

```bash
run-assign-and-predict-workflow --input_dir /path/to/genome/fasta --genome_list /path/to/genome_list.csv --genome_type strain --mmseqs_db /path/to/mmseqs_db --clusters_tsv /path/to/clusters.tsv --feature_map /path/to/selected_features.csv --output_dir /path/to/output_dir --tmp_dir /path/to/tmp_dir --model_dir /path/to/model_dir --phage_feature_table /path/to/phage_feature_table.csv --threads 4

run_full_feature_workflow(
    input_path_strain="/path/to/host/fasta",
    input_path_phage="/path/to/phage/fasta",
    interaction_matrix="/path/to/interaction_matrix.csv",
    output_dir="/path/to/output_dir",
    threads=4
)
```

    base_output_dir="/path/to/output_dir",
    threads=4,
    num_features=100,
    num_runs_fs=10
)
```

### Modeling Workflow

Run the modeling workflow using selected features and evaluate model performance using metrics such as MCC, AUC, F1-Score, Precision and Recall. Generates performance plots to evaluate and compare feature selection thresholds.
